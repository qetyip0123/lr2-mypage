    <h2>What</h2>
    <p>A BMS difficulty table reinterpreting Insane BMS (GENOSIDE / Satellite / Stella / even some Normal) chart
      difficulties at DoubleTime speed (~x1.5)
      to their <a href="https://stellabms.xyz/" target="_blank">Stella</a> table equivalent rating.</p>

    </p>
    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>Mostly made as some kind of a joke during derust / clear drought. Besides it also works as some kind of a skill
      bridge; you can try improving speed by playing less dense charts at faster speed to compensate while also prepare
      for the super hard charts at the higher end of the scale.</p>
